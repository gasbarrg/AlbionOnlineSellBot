# AlbionOnlineSellBot
Albion Online script used to automatically sell all items in your inventory for slightly under market value. Usually for getting rid of junk quickly. 

This SHOULD work on all screen resolutions, but I cannot guarantee as the in game UI may change with significant resizing. 
Uses random delays between mouse movements and clicks to hopefully avoid any anti-cheat. 
Use at your own risk. I have used it a decent bit with no issues.
